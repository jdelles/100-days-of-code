# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 27, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**
- "... The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning." 
- Registered for https://www.theodinproject.com/ (found in resources!) and connected to GitHub
- Joined the Discord server
- Foundations: How this course will work
- Foundations: Introduction to Web Development
- Foundations: Motivation and Mindset


**Thoughts:** 
Intentions: To supplement my CS education @NCState by stiving for 100 days of code. The Odin Project has 105 lessons in the foundations and JavaScript path. If I am able to complete them all before 100 days, I will find something else to work on. 

Commitment: I will push to GitHub every day and tweet out the days progress. 

### Day 1: April 28, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Foundations: Join the Odin community
- Foundations: How does the web work? 
- Foundations: Installation overview
- Foundations: Prerequisites
- Foundations: Text editors
- Foundations: Command line basics
- Foundations: Setting up git
- Foundations: Introduction to git
- Foundations: Git basics

**Thoughts**: 
Got caught up sharing a Knights and Knaves puzzle with my team and my daughters today.

Installation overview almost has me convinced to install Ubantu on my shiny new macbook pro... almost. 

Most importantly, I learned how to manage 2 github accounts with different SSH keys; One for school and one for my personal account!

### Day 2: April 29, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Had some CS class extra credit to work on.
- Built out Java based Tic Tac Toe game and played it with the kids 
- Hoping to get back to TOP Foundations later tonight. 

**Thoughts**: 
Tic Tac Toe was one of the final projects available for my intro CS course last fall. I chose to build MasterMind instead.... and it took weeks and a teammate. Tic Tac Toe on the other hand took less than a day and that's with figuring out how to build a simple but nice looking GUI to go with it. 

### Day 3: April 30, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Foundations: Introduction to the front-end - in progress

**Thoughts**: 
Today was a great day! I got my final CS project of the semester graded - 100% on the coding; 95.6% overall - I got marked down some on my original design. (Still so much room to learn on the overall SLDC especially building a design from a list of requirements!)

I'm all I have left is some extra credit work and then I'm off for several weeks before taking data structures over the summer semester.... more time for The Odin Project!! 

I consider myself intermediate at HTML and CSS. I've been building websites since the 90s - but always looking forward to learning more! The emphasis on user experience in the front-end reflects my entire body of professional experience to date. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files
According to Mozilla - my file structure for a website should be: 
index.html
/images
/styles
/scripts

The same article also talked about separating words with in a file name or url with - instead of _ because Google search regards a - as a word separator but does not consider an _ to be so. Spaces are also to be avoided because not all browsers handle spaces the same way. 

### Day 4: May 1, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Searching and sorting algorithms in CS for extra credit 
- Foundations: Introduction to the front-end
- Foundations: HTML and CSS Basics
- - - Refers to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/ (looks like we'll be on this step for bit!)

**Thoughts**: 
Squeezed in an hour between running, grocery shopping and tennis. Weekends may be the toughest to stick with an hour a day. 


### Day 5: May 2, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Seaching, Sorting and Binary Search Trees in my CS class
- Worked on website

**Thoughts**: 
- Focus was getting through the last few elements of my CS classes. Should be getting a 4.0 this term! 
- Heading back to freeCodeCamp next

### Day 6: May 3, 2021
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
- freeCodeCamp: Learn Basic CSS
- freeCodeCamp: Applied Visual Design
- freeCodeCamp: Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts**: 
These courses are well structured. I may incorporate this into my training program at work soon. They keep asking for $5 - I gave it to them. Invest in your dreams! 

I actually learned a fair bit about CSS animation. It was fun to color in a penguin, make a heart, and make the heart beat! The 300 hour estimate seems excessive - but I also haven't hit the projects yet!
