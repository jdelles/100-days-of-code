- "... The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning." 

- Registered for https://www.theodinproject.com/ (found in resources!) and connected to GitHub
- Joined the Discord server

- Foundations: How this course will work
- Foundations: Introduction to Web Development
- Foundations: Motivation and Mindset


**Thoughts:** 
Intentions: To supplement my CS education @NCState by stiving for 100 days of code. The Odin Project has 105 lessons in the foundations and JavaScript path. If I am able to complete them all before 100 days, I will find something else to work on. 

Commitment: I will push to GitHub every day and tweet out the days progress.
